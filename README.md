# CDB_Obesity_estimation

Project for the Data Science in Biomedicine subject of the Master in Data Science. The main objective of the project is to perform an exploratory data analysis and build some models to estimate the obesisty level.


# Data

The dataset is available from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) and you can access it from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition+). Also, in the **Dataset for estimation of obesity levels based on eating habits and physical condition in individuals from Colombia, Peru and Mexico.pdf** you can find all the information about how the data have been taken and generated.


# Results

In the **Exploratory data analysis.ipynb** I perform the corresponding analysis of the data and in the **Models.ipynb** I build and train some models to estimate the obesity level. In the next image you can see the confusion matrix of the best model for the tow situations I have explored: when the target have 3 and 4 levels.

Finally, you can find the **Presentaci√≥n_Pablo_Hernandez_Camara** which is the presentation that I had to make.
