# CDB_Obesity_estimation

Project for the Data Science in Biomedicine subject of the Master in Data Science. The main objective of the project is to perform an exploratory data analysis and build some models to estimate the obesisty level of the patients.


# Data

The dataset is from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) and can be accessed from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition+). Also, in the **Dataset for estimation of obesity levels based on eating habits and physical condition in individuals from Colombia, Peru and Mexico.pdf** you can find all the information about how the data have been taken and generated. It is also attached as a zip file in the **ObesityDataSet_raw_and_data_sinthetic.zip**.


# Results

In the **Exploratory data analysis.ipynb** the corresponding analysis of the data is performed. It includes the univariate analysys of each variable and the bivariate analysis of each variable with the objective variable. In the **Models.ipynb** some models are built and trained to estimate the obesity level. The next image shows the confusion matrix of the best models (find them in **Models.ipynb**) for the two situations that have been explored: when the target has 3 and 4 levels.

Finally, **Presentaci√≥n_Pablo_Hernandez_Camara** is the presentation of the work, where the dataset, the data analysis, the models and the results are exposed.
